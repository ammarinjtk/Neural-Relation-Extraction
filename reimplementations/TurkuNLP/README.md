## Deep Learning with Minimal Training Data: TurkuNLP Entry in the BioNLP Shared Task 2016

The section contains the code used for [Deep Learning with Minimal Training Data: TurkuNLP Entry in the BioNLP Shared Task 2016](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W16-3009) paper.

To reimplement this model, you are supposed to download the required material files as follows:

- [Pre-trained word2vec](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eXeHKZh_PhxA2hf0NRDpODBZ4zk6L711/view?usp=sharing)

And update the path setting variables: `DATA_DIR_PATH`, `W2V_MODEL_PATH`, and `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH`, in `constants.py` to your local environments.

After that, to create the predictions, run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

The `main.py` will ......
